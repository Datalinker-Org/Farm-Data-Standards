![FarmDataEntities](FMDS_FarmDataEntities.png "The Farm Model data dictionary defines the following Farm Data Entities")
 
 Areas are to be specified in m<sup>2</sup> for compliance with international standards<sup id="INSPIRE">[1](#f1)</sup>. These measurements can be converted, for example to hectares and does not affect what end users will see.

##### [Farm Entity](FMDS_Farm-Data-Entities_Farm-Entity.md)

This includes dairy reproduction, sheep, beef, or deer reproduction, dairy mortality and replacements, sheep, beef, or deer mortality and replacements, dairy mastitis and lameness, milk production, carcass production, and wool and velvet production.

##### [Management Blocks](FMDS_Farm-Data-Entities_Management-Blocks.md)

This section defines items in entities that summarise feed and grazing, including grazing for young dairy replacements on the milking area, grazing for dry cows, grazing and feed activities for sheep, beef cattle, deer, and goats, crops grazed and feed harvested, and imported supplements fed out on effective area during season. 

##### [Irrigation Practices and Systems](FMDS_Farm-Data-Entities_Irrigation-Practices-and-Systems.md)

This section defines items in entities that summarise irrigation on a block or farm.

##### [Farm Structures](FMDS_Farm-Data-Entities_Farm-Structures.md)

This section defines attributes applying to common farm structures, including identification of each structure, details of dairy shed, description and usage of feed pads, stand-offs, and housing, and details of the effluent system.

##### Inventory items for feeds and crops

Refer to the [Supplementary Feed Observations](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Pasture%20Graze%20and%20Feed/PGFDS_Pasture_Grazing_and_Feed_Data_Dictionary.md#Supplementary-Feed-Observations) in the Grazing and Feed Data Standard for Inventory entities.

##### Climate Zones

The following table defines attributes of the climate zone for the farm.  For entering the name, coordinates, and shape of the climate zone, use the spatial attributes defined in [Spatial Attributes](FMDS_Identification-of-Locations-and-Herds.md#Spatial-Attributes) For Climate Data, see the [Climatic and Weather Observations](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Irrigation%20and%20Effluent/IEDS_Irrigation-and-Effluent-Observations-and-Attributes.md#Climatic-and-Weather-Observations) in the Irrigation and Effluent Data Standard.  

##### [Soil Body](FMDS_Farm-Data-Entities_Soil-Body.md)

This section defines attributes of the soil zone for the farm, including soil description and profile and representative soil test results for the effective area.

##### Fertiliser Applications

Refer to the in the Land Application Data Standard for [Fertiliser Applications entities](https://github.com/Datalinker-Org/Farm-Data-Standards/blob/master/Land%20Application%20Standard/LADS_Components-of-Land-Application-Data-Interchange.md#Application-Information).
