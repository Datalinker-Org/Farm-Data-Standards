### For Farmers – Re-use data, reduce duplication

###### Pastoral farming is a data rich activity.

Better decisions around environmental compliance, improved productivity and business profitability require a farmer to draw together numerous data sets around location, soils, climate, animals, feeds, genetics, animal health, fertiliser, chemicals and so on.

These data demands, and opportunities to benefit from better information, will only grow over time.

The Data Standards support **organisations** to store and transfer data in a consistent way so that farm data can be transferred more easily from one system to another. As organisations align their systems to the Farm Data Standards, farmers will see less double-entry of data and there’ll be reduced cost in data collection and transfer.

Farmers don’t have to do anything new. It’s up to your farm systems providers and industry organisations to invest in aligning their systems to the Farm Data Standards.

> “One thing farmers are always saying is that they are sick and tired of having to supply data three, four or five times to different people. It’s all about putting systems in place and getting the ground work right.”
