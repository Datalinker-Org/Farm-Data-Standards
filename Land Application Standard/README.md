## The Land Application Data Standard

Broad adoption of a common vocabulary and data dictionary for exchange of farm information will result in farmers and other industry parties entering data only once and having that data readily accessible for populating multiple decision–making systems. As a result, industry and individual farm businesses will be better placed to undertake systems analysis to inform management practice. More accurate and structured interchange of farm data will also support industry breeding objectives and other information system targets.

#### Scope and Application

This standard addresses the data required for both the planned and the actual applications of fertiliser, herbicide and pesticide.

The information specified includes:

* the customer order;

* the area spread;

* product details including nutrient information;

* spatial representation of the spread and spray tracks and of any ecological hot-spots. 

Adoption of this standard will provide compatibility between spreading control equipment and fertiliser company databases.
