### Feature Catalogue

Contents:
* [Farm Features](#Farm-Features)
* [Feature Hierarchy](#Feature-Hierarchy)

This section of the document is a Feature Catalogue aligned to terms described in [ISO 19110](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:19110:ed-1:v1:en). Use of features for agricultural purposes overlaps with other uses of the same feature types, and as a result many of the features listed here are defined in other standards. 

Overlaps are resolved as follows:

* The primary standard for any feature types in another domain is referenced beside that feature type; and

* The [Feature Attributes Data Dictionary](FFADS_Feature-Attributes-Data-Dictionary.md) describes attributes for these features that are most relevant to the NZ primary sector, but does not reproduce all attributes from a referenced Standard. The reader is to use the referenced Standard as the definitive source to ascertain relevant attributes.

#### Feature Hierarchy

The diagram below illustrates the hierarchy of each spatial feature as defined by NZ Farm Data Standards, beginning with the Holding as the broad definition of the total farm area. Each vertical level represents a sub-layer of the preceding feature.
