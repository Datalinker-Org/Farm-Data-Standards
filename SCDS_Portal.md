## Stock Reconciliation Standard

Broad adoption of a common vocabulary and data dictionary for exchange of farm information will result in farmers and other industry parties entering data only once and having that data readily accessible for populating multiple decision â€“making systems. As a result, industry and individual farm businesses will be better placed to undertake systems analysis to inform management practice. More accurate and structured interchange of farm data will also support industry breeding objectives and other information system targets.

#### Scope and Application
This standard addresses terminologies applied by industry to livestock reconciliations and any other change of stock numbers data.  The purpose of this document is to standardise terminology and representations of data in order to ease future interchange of this and other data.
