An Event is used to describe a range of activities associated with the management of health and safety on farm. These events may be linked to people, locations, and features for which information is already recorded and is relevant to the event information. Note that the Notifiable event type is distinct from the Accident, Incident, or Near Miss Event in that the latter is for farm management purposes with no associated legal requirements or definitions. It is recommended that events [SHOULD](docs/HSDS_Definitions-and-Abbreviations_Interpretation.md#Interpretation) be recorded with a unique identifier to allow for the linking of events with other relevant farm data.
