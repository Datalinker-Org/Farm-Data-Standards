## The Health and Safety Data Standards

#### Outcome Statement

Broad adoption of a common vocabulary and data dictionary for exchange of farm information will result in farmers and other industry parties entering data only once and having that data readily accessible for populating multiple decision-making systems. As a result, industry and individual farm businesses will be better placed to undertake systems analysis to inform management practice. More accurate and structured interchange of farm data will also support industry performance objectives and other information system targets.

#### Scope and Application

This standard relates to the management of Health and Safety on farm.

The standard addresses:

* Hazards and Risks

* People and Roles 

* Events
