### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How does this affect farmers?

This is all about improving data exchange between the systems that store and manage your farm data. Farmers don’t have to do anything new. It’s up to your farm systems providers and industry organisations to invest in aligning their systems to the Farm Data Standards.

#### Why are Industry Bodies Funding the Data Standards?

Both DairyNZ and the Red Meat Profit Partnership have identified that building a more effective and efficient farm data environment is a critical part of delivering our increased productivity and profitability goals.

Re-use of farm data is an important element. By collecting and storing data in a consistent, industry agreed manner, we will see increased movement of data across the sector. This will save farmer’s time and will drive innovative new insights and technology solutions as organisations have better data sets to work with.

#### How does this relate to the Code of Practice and Data Linker?

These are complementary tools also aimed at improving use of farm data, and making it easier to share data between systems. These have also been driven and funded by DairyNZ, the Red Meat Profit Partnership and MPI through the Primary Growth Partnership programme.

The Farm Data Code of Practice outlines a set of disclosures, practices and policies for organisations that store and manage farm data. It builds transparency for farmers about the way in which your data is handled, and provides peace of mind that your data is managed securely. Go to the Code of Practice website for more information.

Data Linker is a tool to make secure data transfer between multiple parties efficient and cost-effective. Data Providers identify data sets which can be shared, and other applications can register to receive that data for their farmer clients. Farmers authorize permission for their data to be shared, allowing regular and frequent data exchange to keep your systems up to date. Go to the Data Linker website for more information.

#### How were the Data Standards developed?

A Steering Group representing industry interests has overseen the development of these Data Standards. Rezare Systems was contracted to consult as widely as possible with industry and business organisations. Typically, workshops have been held to discuss scope and content for each Data Standard. A draft standard is then developed and circulated for comment and feedback. A LinkedIn group has been formed to keep people informed and invite feedback. Once the Steering Group believes that there is industry agreement on the Data Standard it is ‘published’ and made available on the website.
