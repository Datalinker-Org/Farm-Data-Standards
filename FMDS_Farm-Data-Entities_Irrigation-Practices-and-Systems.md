The following table defines items in entities that summarise irrigation. See the Irrigation and Effluent Data Standard for the full [Data Dictionary on irrigation and effluent](docs/IEDS_Irrigation-and-Effluent-Data-Dictionary.md).

#### Irrigation on a block or farm

Attributes | Data Types | Notes
:--------- | :--------- | :----
Average irrigation interval	| Integer | Time taken for irrigator to return to its starting point or days taken to irrigate farm, days.
Method of irrigation | Enumeration | See [Irrigation Equipment Observations](docs/IEDS_Irrigation-and-Effluent-Data-Dictionary.md#Irrigation-Equipment-Observations) in the Irrigation & Effluent Data Standard.
Area irrigated | Integer | Area expressed in m2 (SI unit) or hectares (ha, accepted non-SI unit). Implementations must clearly specify which unit is used, and ensure consistent use. For spatial data interchange m2 should be used[^INSPIRE/AU]. 
Days irrigated | Integer | Number of days of season irrigated.
Total metered water	| Integer | m3
Instantaneous flow rate	| Integer | l/sec/ha
Flow rate | Integer | Flow rate for bore/borderdyke, l/sec
