### Animal Breed List

Contents:
* [Cattle](#Cattle)
* [Sheep](#Sheep)
* [Deer](#Deer)
* [Goat](#Goat)

The Animal Breed List below corresponds to the Breed Assessed item in the Animal Data Standard, which defines two data fields to describe Breed:

1. Breed Assessed represents a visual assessment of an animal's primary or major breed; and

2. Breed Distribution is a two-dimensional matrix of breed identifiers and the proportion of each breed in the animal.

Some Breed names will be suitable for use in a visual assessment of breed, but would not be suitable for use in describing Breed Distribution, and vice versa. For cattle, the formal codes are defined by the ICAR 2 character and 3 character codes where they exist, and informal codes by the prefix column. Where there is an *symbol next to the prefix for the Cattle breed, this indicates an "informal" prefix, where an ICAR 2 character or 3 character code is already listed.

Data for the Animal Breed list uses the following sources: ICAR Interbull Breed Codes, FAO DAD-IS, SIL, FarmIQ, pureFarming, and Oklahoma State University. Links to these sources can be found in the Referenced Documents section of the Animal Data Standard.
