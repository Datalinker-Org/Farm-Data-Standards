## Animal Data Standards

Broad adoption of a common vocabulary and data dictionary for exchange of farm information will result in farmers and other industry parties entering data only once and having that data readily accessible for populating multiple decision-making systems. As a result, industry and individual farm businesses will be better placed to undertake systems analysis to inform management practice. More accurate and structured interchange of farm data will also support industry breeding objectives and other information system targets.

##### Scope and Application

This standard addresses the following areas:

* The identification of animals, herds, and locations

* Animal “life data” including animal characteristics, parentage, and state information.

* Representation of collective groups of animals ranging from herds or flocks, physical management groups such as mobs through to logical groups for analysis and planned groups such as a draft list.

* Observations including records of an activity carried out, events that have occurred and measurements that have been taken.
