### Groups of Animals

This section of the Standard defines how to represent a collective group of animals. Animals are grouped for many purposes, and often data is recorded on a group of animals as a whole rather than (or as well as) individuals. 

Groups may be defined and used for different purposes:

* A herd of animals may be recognised as a contemporary group for genetic analysis purposes, or as the entity at which control is exercised over animals for traceability purposes;

* A mob of animals is frequently used as an entity to which collective observations can be applied, for instance moving a mob of animals from one paddock to another, or drenching an entire mob of animals;

* A session is frequently used by on-farm data capture systems to describe the group of animals that were handled and measured at the same time (the group of cows present at milking or the group of sheep weighed and vaccinated together); 

* Drafting Lists or Groups are provided to on-farm control equipment to allow animals to be automatically drafted into different pens by equipment that reads [EID](docs/ADS_Definitions-And-Abbreviations_Interpretation.md#Definitions-And-Abbreviations) tags and controls gates; and

* Groups of animals are also defined for reporting and comparison purposes in farm management software.

This Standard does not define all methods by which groups of animals may be defined and used in software and electronic systems. It does define a mechanism by which information about a group of animals can be interchanged:

* Expressing the set of groups to which an animal belongs or has belonged in the past;

* Expressing the current members of a group;

* Identifying a group as a subject of an observation.


_The attributes of a Group are listed in [Group Membership](docs/ADS_Animal-Lifecycle-Data-Dictionary_Group-Membership.md)._
