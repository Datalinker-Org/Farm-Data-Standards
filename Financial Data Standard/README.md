## Financial Data Standard

Broad adoption of a common vocabulary and data dictionary for exchange of farm information will result in farmers and other industry parties entering data only once and having that data readily accessible for populating multiple decision-making systems. As a result, industry and individual farm businesses will be better placed to undertake systems analysis to inform management practice. More accurate and structured interchange of farm data will also support industry performance targets and benchmarking.

#### Scope and Application

This standard addresses the following areas of data interchange:

* Representing transactional financial information, either in budget or actual transactions;

* Representing balance sheet information; and

* Representing key performance indicators typically used in benchmarking or comparison of farm systems, or in concert with financial reporting of a farming enterprise.

The data dictionaries defined in this standard are intended to support standardised interchange of financial data for benchmarking, tools, and analysis, and are not intended as a mechanism for E-Commerce (other standards such as [EDIFACT](FDS_Definitions-and-Abbreviations_Interpretation.md#Definitions-and-Abbreviations), [UBL](FDS_Definitions-and-Abbreviations_Interpretation.md#Definitions-and-Abbreviations) and [EANCOM/GS1 XML](FDS_Definitions-and-Abbreviations_Interpretation.md#Definitions-and-Abbreviations) support this).
