The following table defines grazing summaries. In contrast to grazing events, a grazing summary describes a longer duration grazing interaction between mobs of animals and a farm or block, which may summarise multiple individual grazing events. A grazing summary requires both a date and duration (which may be specified in the Observation Date).
