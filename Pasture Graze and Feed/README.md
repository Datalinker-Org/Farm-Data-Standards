## Pasture, Grazing and Feed Data Standard

Broad adoption of a common vocabulary and data dictionary for exchange of farm information will result in farmers and other industry parties entering data only once and having that data readily accessible for populating multiple decision-making systems. As a result, industry and individual farm businesses will be better placed to undertake systems analysis to inform management practice. More accurate and structured interchange of farm data will also support industry breeding objectives and other information system targets.

#### Scope and Application

This standard addresses the following areas:
* Harvesting, purchase, storage, utilisation and sale of supplementary feeds.
* Grazing observations and summaries of grazing off and grazing systems
* Pasture growth, pasture, and feed analysis
* Monitoring of pasture pests and weeds.
